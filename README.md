# DevOps-for-Machine-Learning-with-Azure-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to create a DevOps pipeline that automates the machine learning model lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment. We'll use AWS SageMaker to train and deploy machine learning models, and AWS CodePipeline to manage the pipeline and automate the deployment process.
